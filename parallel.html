    <h2 >MYSTERY</h2>
    <p><h3>The great mystery of life....</br>
        Life is too mysterious,</br>
        Too long to count on faults,</br>
        But quite short to love others,</br>
        Yet ideal to build great exalts...</p>
        
        Here every morning gives us opportunities,</br>
        Every second accelerates a new start,</br>
        Still tomorrows are the most awaited guests,</br>
        And we people call ourselves smart!</p>
        
        Every second we come closer too death,</br>
        Yet birthdays are gala celebrations,</br>
        Death allows us to meet the almighty,</br>
        Yet they are mourning occasions...</p>
        
        We are the creators of our own destiny,</br>
        Yet zodiacs are so very popular,</br>
        Lies are evident, yet ignored,</br>
        Truths are sins, search them with a binocular!</p>
        
        Relations are the pillars of our life,</br>
        Quite weak yet we live for so long,</br>
        It's so very difficult to state somebody right,</br>
        But easiest to describe somebody as wrong....</p>
        
        Humans thrive for faithful relationships,</br>
        Still possess the quality of betrayal,</br>
        Sky is the limit for imaginations,</br>
        But it's so very tough to know somebody's real portrayal..</p>
        
        The ones with limitless patience,</br>
        Are often described as fools,</br>
        The great geniuses with remarkable minds,</br>
        Have actually got no place in the schools...</p>
        
        Uniqueness is often criticized,</br>
        Following the majority is the ideal path, </br>
        Wrongs are appreciated or ignored,</br>
        But good deeds are the deservers of wrath...</p>
        
        You may think that life is easy,</br>
        Its strange but quite rife,</br>
        But mind my words friends,</br>
        It's really tough to reveal the great mystery of life....</h3>
